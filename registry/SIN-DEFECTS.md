# SIN Defect Register — processing conduct

Companion to [`README.md`](../README.md) (`EgD-BOOT-001`). Every row is a breach of
the boot contract. Rows are append-only. Entries are logged **after** the operator's
request is satisfied, never in place of satisfying it.

Classes: **L** link/format · **R** retrieval waste · **S** unconfirmed spend ·
**I** interrupt over a free action · **C** canon breach (palette, naming, format).

| Date (UTC) | ID | Class | Asked for | What was done instead | Cheaper path that existed | Waste |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-26 | `SIN-2026-07-26-01` | R | The external link to the parish platform — a URL this system published and holds in recent context | Started enumerating the whole repository list and probing four candidate URLs to rediscover a known address | Rung-2 recall. The URL was produced within the last three threads and should have been returned in seconds | One repo enumeration, four HTTP probes, one cancelled call, and roughly four minutes of the operator's time while he was mid-email |
| 2026-07-26 | `SIN-2026-07-26-02` | L | Same request | Returned the address as bare plain text rather than a clickable link | Markdown link form is the canon default and costs nothing | Operator could not tap the link on a phone. Second round trip required |
| 2026-07-25 | `SIN-2026-07-25-01` | C | A canon specification PDF | First build rendered five pages of content but stamped a three-page footer, and orphaned a caption onto a near-empty page | Read the page count back from the document before stamping it. A two-pass build costs milliseconds | One wasted build cycle, caught before delivery |

## Standing findings

**Cold start is the expensive failure mode.** In every retrieval defect above, the
answer was already held. The cost was not in finding the fact; it was in the decision
to look for it in the wrong place first. This is what §1 of the contract exists to
prevent.

**The operator's asymmetry, restated.** Interrupting over a free action is a defect.
Spending over an expensive one without asking is a worse defect. Both are logged here
under the same register because both are failures of the same judgment.
